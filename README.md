# Deep-face-detection

This is a end to end project in which the whole set of the images are captured by webcam with the help of OpenCV and then with the help of labelme module rectangle has been drawn around the face.
With the help of keras functional API module two problem has been solved:
1) Classification Problem----> The Model will predict whether the face is present in the frame or not
2) Regression Problem------> The model will predict the two coodinate points of the rectangle around the face

In this project an extensive Use of openCV and file handling has been done.
The tensorflow data Pipeline has been built to taken the images from different folders

Finally the model has been trained.
